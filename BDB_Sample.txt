Tradeport Batch monitoring dashboard

Aiming at manual task reduction, faster discovery & recovery and ease of know the actual batch status, dashboard was designed and developed by TS team and it’s in use effective April. The Techstack used is Angular JS 2, SpringBot, Maven and Tomcat

Problem statement:
-          No visual view of batch status and lack of front end to monitor
-          Not proactive and Often waits for failure alert tickets to manage the incident in reactive way
-          Busy and tight batch window managed by a single person leads to accumulation of issues and risk to service
-          Comprehensive Run stats are not available for opportunities to fix and enhance the problematic components
-          Hourly stats and unusual behaviour are being prepared by Batch support personnel manually for internal sharing
-          Manual work for batch support to check the status manually for every country


-          Easy Graphical reference of overall status of the batch
-          Stay ahead and be Proactive and engage relevant activities in place of waiting for a failure
-          Increases the efficiency of Batch support personnel by reducing manual work
-          Provides a platform for Tech team to pick opportunities to enhance and optimize



-          Business will be beneficial of this proactive action from PSS. Issues like Delayed online window, missing cutoff and inconsistent interface deliveries can be avoided with proactive management
-          Tech support Batch personnel will have automated dashboard and can be atop the situation
